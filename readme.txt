This repository contains a few c++ programs designed around the Collatz Conjecture.
The Collatz Conjecture is as follows:
	Start with any number n
	If n is even, divide n by 2
	if n is odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1

No matter what number n is, it will eventually become 1 by applying these steps.
These programs help explore the Collatz Conjecture.
